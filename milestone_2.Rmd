Github repo with Rmd (and knitted html) which discusses pros and cons two projects from past years. At least one project should be one which did extensive data gathering/cleaning. You should not select the same projects for commentary as your friends have. Students generally write about a paragraph for each project. The Rmd/html file should include the url for your repo. The only thing you are submitting is the html, via Canvas.

## State of the Union Text Analysis by Will Schrepferman

Screpferman's project seems to do a great deal of text analysis and data 
collection. One thing that I would improve about his project is the data
visualization of the topic models. Without the description, it is a bit
unclear what the topics are about. Also, for the models divided by presidents
it would've been nicer to have the visualization in descending order of the
term with the highest frequency to term with the lowest frequency. A positive
of his project is that it seems incredibly unique, especially the part about
RoBama. Another con of his project is the repetition of many of the same
commands with different arguments. As I have been told, there is probably an
easier way to get the same result.
